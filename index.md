Why do Goodreads users love and love to hate the "classics" ? Which books are "classics" according to millions of readers? Why does Amazon seem to care about the classics, too?

We explore these questions and more in our essay, ["The Goodreads 'Classics': A Computational Study of Readers, Amazon, and Crowdsourced Amateur Criticism,"](https://post45.org/2021/04/the-goodreads-classics-a-computational-study-of-readers-amazon-and-crowdsourced-amateur-criticism/) in which we analyze more than 120,000 user reviews.

This website hosts interactive versions of some of the data visualizations featured in our essay â€”Â as well as a few bonus visualizations ðŸŽ‰ We hope you have fun exploring and taking a data-driven view of the "classics."
