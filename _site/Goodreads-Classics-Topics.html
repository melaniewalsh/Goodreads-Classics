<h1 id="the-goodreads-classics-by-topic">The Goodreads Classics By Topic</h1>

<p>This heatmap represents the probability that Goodreads reviews for a given <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/genres/classics">classic</a> would discuss or contain one of the 30 topics on the left. These topics were produced by topic
      modeling 120,000 Goodreads reviews of classic books.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Darker tiles indicate a higher probability of containing the topic</li>
  <li>Lighter tiles indicate a lower probability of containing the topic</li>
</ul>

<p>You can hover over each tile to see more information, including the words from the Goodreads reviews that make up each “topic” (e.g., “School” = “school”, “high”, “class”, “english”).</p>

<h2 id="more-about-this-plot">More About This Plot</h2>

<p>To read this plot, it can be helpful to consider a few examples. If you scan left-to-right for the “School” topic, you will see that <i>To Kill a Mocking Bird</i>, <i>The Great Gatsby</i>, and <i>The Catcher in the Rye</i> have the darkest tiles in this row, which indicates that reviews of these books are most likely to discuss school-related subjects.</p>

<p>If you scan top-to-bottom for <i>Pride and Prejudice</i>, to take another example, you will see that the novel has darker tiles for the topics “Audiobooks &amp; Adaptations,” “Marriage,” “Re-Readable,” and “Gushing &amp; Loving Language.”</p>

<p>The topic probabilities have been normalized to highlight differences between the books. We check the significance of these results via 95% bootstrapped confidence intervals, and the majority of visible differences are significant. You can explore a <a href="/Goodreads-Classics-Topics-Standalone.html">standalone version of this plot here</a>.</p>

<p>This plot was created with the JavaScript data visualization library <a href="https://d3js.org/">d3</a>. The code was inspired by and partly borrowed from <a href="https://www.d3-graph-gallery.com/graph/heatmap_style.html">Yan Holtz</a>.</p>
